Leftmost:
First test: Identify the leftmost point, which is P2=(1,3).
Second test: From P2, we find the next point M. For each point Pjâ€‹, compute the orientation with respect to P2. 
The candidate that results in a counterclockwise turn becomes the next point.
Third test: After selecting M, we repeat the process to find M's successor, comparing all other points to find the next counterclockwise turn.

Lowest:
First test: Identify the lowest point, which is P1=(2,-1).
